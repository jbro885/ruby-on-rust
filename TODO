lexer: ruby-lexer-gem: what's about @tokens and @token_queue

lexer: CRITICAL not handling utf8 now

lexer: ragel, p, @p

all: unite T_IDENTIFIER TIdentifier

lexer:
  currently we only stored token's value, and dropped the location info

lexer:
  simplify generator:
    write the patterns table at once, before looping

lexer:
  handle eof
    we can't really `match` eof, we detect p > len

lexer:
  currently, we pass lexer.tokens into Literal, to emit tokens inside the literal. Yet we have to impl token emitting twice. we could try
  a) pass in a callback closure instead. (FAILED due to complex lifetime issue)
  b) wrap tokens as a struct and impl trait on it
